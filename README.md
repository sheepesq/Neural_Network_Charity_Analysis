# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis #

## Overview of the analysis:##
- Formulate a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup

## Results ##
### Data Preprocessing ###
- We dropped the columns EIN and name because they are not necessary to this process
- the column of focus for the project was Is_Successful 

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model ###
- The model itself was not very helpful as the models accuracy was under 75% and this not enough to help predict the success or failure of the donation 

## Summary ##
- As was stated above this model did not reach the minium goal of 75% accuracy so it will not be helpful to the team.
